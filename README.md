# Todo List
Todo List is a simple project built using React, TypeScript, and Vite. This application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their tasks and store them locally in Local Storage. 

## Features
- Create: Add new tasks to your todo list.
- Read: View your existing tasks and their completion status.
- Update: Edit task title and description.
